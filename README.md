# MY STUDY ROADMAP
## A challenge project from [DIO](https://digitalinnovation.one/) about Git/Github functionalities

### Based on my instructors and other professionals, to form a rich knowledge in software development you need to search about the new technologies. But not only this, if you want to improve your career you need to search about the tech that are actually used in the industry. So i am creating a roadmap based path for me and others beginners that want to join me

#### This roadmap was made by analysis of previous knowledge and companies's home pages showing their main used tech

<br>

First roadmap for back-end, the memory management knowledge i see as a important path to take in the first place, the rest i put by taking a first look at the software they are using in the home page of some companies
